&lt;p&gt;On December 6th 2014, in celebration of Sony's 20 years of Playstation, EA Chief Operating Officer Peter Moore took the stage at Sony’s PlayStation Experience event. He revealed that Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Mirror’s Edge, and Plants Vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare were all free to download in the PlayStation Store for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dealspwn.com/writer/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Playstation_Birthday_v5.jpg" alt="PS EA Offer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/need-speed-mirrors-edge-plants-vs-zombies-free-playstation-right-now/#ixzz3LV5HF8Ga"&gt;Read more about the offer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story of how 5 guys preyed on that announcement, and made some good money as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a warm Saturday afternoon, these guys were lounging in the sitting room, playing Fifa, when an unexpected phone call arrived. It was their friend Abat, notifying them of the offer,only a few hours before it's end. &lt;br&gt;
At first, they're not really interested in it. After all, only few of them have consoles, and the rest considered the games to be childish. &lt;br&gt;
They were Fifa die hards through and through. &lt;br&gt;
But one of them saw an opportunity, and as we all know, nothing,  and I mean, &lt;strong&gt;nothing motivates a human being like the smell of money&lt;/strong&gt; (except maybe sex, and food...and a couple of other things. Ok so, maybe not nothing. But you get the point.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mere minutes, all 5 guys were on their laptops, setting up PSN accounts for their fake users. The process was rather simple...22 Jump Street simple.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough with the stupid jokes. Here's how they did it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1. Setup fake Gmail accounts for each user &lt;br&gt;
Step 2. Register each user account on PSN &lt;br&gt;
Step 3. "Purchase" the games from the Playstation account for each user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the offer ended, they'd set up 103 accounts altogether. They then sold these accounts across several online platforms. Each account was sold for $10, saving the buyer a whole $25 worth of money . The accounts sold like hot cakes...who wouldn't wanna save $25 dollars on a game, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days later, all the accounts had been sold. They split the money evenly, each guy's cut coming to approximately Ksh.18,000 ($200). &lt;br&gt;
In the end, their only regret was not having heard of the offer earlier. &lt;br&gt;
If $1000 dollars was made in 2 hours, can you imagine how much they could have made in the 2 days the offer was running for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Peter Drucker put it:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always be on the lookout for change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://samercostello.github.io/thousand-in-an-hour/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5b1f3bfe-1542-4126-99e8-e254dedd7e41</guid><category>musings</category><dc:creator>Samer Costello</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 13:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
